    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Welcome to My DIY Home! If you’ve been here before, you may notice that things look a little different. I’m usually the one who’s resistant to change, but this is a change I am so excited about.</p>
    <br />

    <p>I started this website completely on a whim, and it evolved into something I never could have imagined. Fifteen years later, I can’t believe I’m still here. This brings me to my big announcement!</p>
    <br />
    <p>I have been working hard to reimagine this website. Along with a great team of editors, we'll bring you a whole bunch of new content, including recipes, shopping tips, design ideas, and more. Of course, I will be here continually telling stories of my cute husband, and sharing pictures of the dogs, the ranch, and all the things I’m cooking.</p>
    <br />
    <p>I can’t wait to see what’s to come. </p>
